This repository is a benchmark dataset for solidity security tools. The dataset is created as a part of a master thesis project at Lund Technical University for tools to check if they can detect reachable self-destruct. Reachable self-destruct is an access control problem, and these contracts can be retrofitted to work for any access control problem. 

All contracts in this dataset are true positives of containing reachable self-destruct and SHOULD NOT BE USED.
